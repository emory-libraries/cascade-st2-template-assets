# Cascade Server Library [Standard] Template v2 Assets

This repository serves as a working space and backup for our template assets which have historically resided in the Cascade Server directly. This space is for creating new workflows for versioning, reviewing, minifying, and possibly Sass-ifying.

## Nest Steps
* Create minifying worker processes for CSS and JS.
* Sass-ify the CSS where possible.
